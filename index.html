                Panther is a robust ad-blocking extension designed to empower users in managing advertisements on their
                Chrome browser. However, it is important to emphasize that this may impact the revenue of content
                creators. If you wish to support them through displaying ads, we encourage you to disable the extension.

                We do not assume responsibility for any legal violations related to online advertising that may arise
                from the use of Panther.
